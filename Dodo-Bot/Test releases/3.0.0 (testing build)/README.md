# dodo bot canary branch
just a branch with lot of experiments lol, currently library used: hytescript.js v4-dev build release

# config.json options
note: as of now, these are optional and you can choose to ignore them but do not delete config.json as it will cause errors after deleting it, during the meantime you can configure this if you want to change on how the bot should work
* **debug**: whether to enable debug mode or not, Default: false
* **logJSErrors**: whether to log javascript errors or not, Default: false
* **respondBots**: whether if the bot should respond to other bots or not, Default: false

# why v3 when v2 exists?
owners of aoi.js didn't really updated v6-dev, no variables and no useful functions just basic ones, v3 makes an switch to different library named hytescript.js (it may switch to djs soon but not planned), v3 aims to be much different than v1 and v2 especially at features and stuff it is currently maintained however it's possible to still get bugs (for example hytescript.js v4 bugs) so use it at your own risk although v2 and v1 will be still maintained (expect v2 for slow development because of this)
